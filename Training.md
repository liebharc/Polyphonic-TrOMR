- Make sure you have installed pytorch and CUDA correctly

## Train log

SER failues shown here should be taken with a grain of salt. The SER is calculated on data which was acquired differently than then training sets, which should make it fair. On the other hand the data is pretty wild and you couldn't expect the SER to be low.

## Next Runs

Try CustomVisionTransformer
Change alpha/beta ratio
Only increase encoder or decoder depth

## Run 79 Use semantic encoding without changes to the accidentals

Date: 27 Apr 2024
Training time: ~18h (fast option)
Commit: f732c3abc10b5b0b3e8942f722d695eb725e3e53
SER: 76%
Manual validation result: 80.9 

So far we used the format which TrOMR seems to use: Semantic format but with accidentals depending on how they are placed.

E.g. the semantic format is Key D Major, Note C#, Note Cb, Note Cb
so the TrOMR will be: Key D Major, Note C, Note Cb, Note C because the flat is the only visible accidental in the image.

With this attempt we try to use the semantic format without any changes to the accidentals.

## Run50 InceptionResnetV2

We changed how we number runs and established a link between the run number and the git history.

Date: 05 Apr 2024
Training time: ~19h (fast option)
Commit: a57ee4c046842c0135adca84f06260cff8af732f
SER: 88%

We tried InceptionResnetV2. The training run showed overfitting and the resulting SER indicates poor results. The model is over 3 times larger than the ResNetV2 model and might require more work to prevent overfitting.

### Run3

Date: 02 Apr 2024
Training time: ~24h (fast option)
Commit: 9ddfff8b5782473e8831ca3791d9bef99f726654
SER: 73%
Manual validation result: 23.4

We decreased the vocabulary, the alpha/beta ratio in the loss function and made changes to the grandstaff dataset. While still performing worse than Run 0 in the manual validation, it gets closer now and in some specific tests performs even better than Run 0. We will have to backtrack from this point to find out which of the changes lead to an improved result.
