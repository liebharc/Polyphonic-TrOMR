Training time: ~17h (fast option), aborted after epoch 16 from 25
Commit: a6b87b71b3b69d87d424f3c86500081f6146d436

## Run50 InceptionResnetV2

We changed how we number runs and established a link between the run number and the git history.

Date: 05 Apr 2024
Training time: ~19h (fast option)
Commit: a57ee4c046842c0135adca84f06260cff8af732f
SER: 88%

We tried InceptionResnetV2. The training run showed overfitting and the resulting SER indicates poor results. The model is over 3 times larger than the ResNetV2 model and might require more work to prevent overfitting.

### Run3

Date: 02 Apr 2024
Training time: ~24h (fast option)
Commit: 9ddfff8b5782473e8831ca3791d9bef99f726654
SER: 73%
Manual validation result: 23.4

We decreased the vocabulary, the alpha/beta ratio in the loss function and made changes to the grandstaff dataset. While still performing worse than Run 0 in the manual validation, it gets closer now and in some specific tests performs even better than Run 0. We will have to backtrack from this point to find out which of the changes lead to an improved result.

### Run2

Date: 01 Apr 2024
Training time: ~48h
Commit: 516093a3f3840cb82922b4d7300d1568455277d568f85ea96fe41235a06ca8de6759f1db6b8fc39a

### Run 0

The weights from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09370).
